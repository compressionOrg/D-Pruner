This Act may be cited as the \"Service Dogs for Veterans Act of 2009\". <SECTION-HEADER> PILOT PROGRAM ON USE OF SERVICE DOGS FOR THE TREATMENT OR REHABILITATION OF VETERANS WITH PHYSICAL OR MENTAL INJURIES OR DISABILITIES. Findings. Congress makes the following findings: The United States owes a profound debt to those who have served the United States honorably in the Armed Forces. Disabled veterans suffer from a range of physical and mental injuries and disabilities. In 2008, the Army reported the highest level of suicides among its soldiers since it began tracking the rate 28 years before 2009. A scientific study documented in the 2008 Rand Report entitled \"Invisible Wounds of War\" estimated that 300,000 veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom currently suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Veterans have benefitted in multiple ways from the provision of service dogs. The Department of Veterans Affairs has been successfully placing guide dogs with the blind since 1961. Thousands of dogs around the country await adoption. Program Required. Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall commence a three-year pilot program to assess the benefits, feasibility, and advisability of using service dogs for the treatment or rehabilitation of veterans with physical or mental injuries or disabilities, including post-traumatic stress disorder. Partnerships. In general. The Secretary shall carry out the pilot program by partnering with nonprofit organizations that have experience providing service dogs to individuals with injuries or disabilities. Do not charge fees for the dogs, services, or lodging that they provide. And are accredited by a generally accepted industry-standard accrediting institution. Reimbursement of costs. The Secretary shall reimburse partners for costs relating to the pilot program as follows: For the first 50 dogs provided under the pilot program, all costs relating to the provision of such dogs. For dogs provided under the pilot program after the first 50 dogs provided, all costs relating to the provision of every other dog. Participation. In general. As part of the pilot program, the Secretary shall provide a service dog to a number of veterans with physical or mental injuries or disabilities that is greater than or equal to the greater of 200. And the minimum number of such veterans required to produce scientifically valid results with respect to assessing the benefits and costs of the use of such dogs for the treatment or rehabilitation of such veterans. Composition. The Secretary shall ensure that half of the participants in the pilot program are veterans who suffer primarily from a mental health injury or disability. And half of the participants in the pilot program are veterans who suffer primarily from a physical injury or disability. Study. In carrying out the pilot program, the Secretary shall conduct a scientifically valid research study of the costs and benefits associated with the use of service dogs for the treatment or rehabilitation of veterans with physical or mental injuries or disabilities. The matters studied shall include the following: The therapeutic benefits to such veterans, including the quality of life benefits reported by the veterans partaking in the pilot program. The economic benefits of using service dogs for the treatment or rehabilitation of such veterans, including savings on health care costs, including savings relating to reductions in hospitalization and reductions in the use of prescription drugs. And productivity and employment gains for the veterans. The effectiveness of using service dogs to prevent suicide. Reports. Annual report of the secretary. After each year of the pilot program, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the findings of the Secretary with respect to the pilot program. Final report by the national academy of sciences. Not later than 180 days after the date of the completion of the pilot program, the National Academy of Sciences shall submit to Congress a report on the results of the pilot program.", "summary": "Service Dogs for Veterans Act of 2009 - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to commence a three-year pilot program to assess the benefits, feasibility, and advisability of using service dogs for the treatment or rehabilitation of veterans with physical or mental injuries or disabilities, including post-traumatic stress disorder.

{"source": "To amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to repeal the long-term goal for reducing to zero the incidental mortality and serious injury of marine mammals in commercial fishing operations, and to modify the goal of take reduction plans for reducing such takings. <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: The goal of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 is to maintain marine mammal species and population stocks at their optimum sustainable populations. If the annual removals of individuals of a species or population stock of marine mammals do not exceed the potential biological removal level, the species or population stock will be maintained at, or reach, its optimum sustainable population. Requiring that commercial fishermen achieve a zero mortality rate goal for a species or population stock of marine mammals that is equal to or less than 10 percent of the potential biological removal of a given marine mammal species or population stock is unnecessary to achieve that Act's goal of maintaining species and stocks at their optimum sustainable population and penalizes commercial fishermen. The Congress intended that the zero mortality rate goal under that Act would be met if fishermen use the best technology that is economically and technologically feasible. Species and populations stocks of marine mammal that have reached historic levels are impeding the recovery of endangered species and threatened species through predation or competition in the ecosystem. The fundamental principles of ecosystem management are defeated by giving one species a preeminent position in the ecosystem through, imposition of a zero mortality rate goal. All persons that interact with marine mammals should seek to reduce and eliminate marine mammal injuries and mortalities through the use of the best equipment and techniques that are economically and technologically feasible. <SECTION-HEADER> MODIFICATION OF GOALS FOR REDUCING INCIDENTAL TAKE OF MARINE MAMMALS IN COMMERCIAL FISHING.

This Act may be cited as the \"Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning Act of 2011\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. The Congress makes the following findings: To succeed in school, students need to be engaged. They need to know how to maintain focus and effort in the face of setbacks, work effectively with others, and be good communicators and problem-solvers. Social and emotional skills form a foundation for young people's success not just in school, but as healthy and caring adults, productive workers, and engaged citizens. Not only can these skills be taught, they can be taught by regular classroom teachers in schools of every type to students of every background. Academic outcomes resulting from social and emotional learning include greater motivation to learn and commitment to school, increased time devoted to schoolwork and mastery of subject matter, improved attendance, graduation rates, grades, and test scores. These positive outcomes increase in students who are involved in social and emotional learning programming by an average of 11 percentile points over students who are not involved in such programming. Social and emotional learning programming also results in reduced problem behavior, improved health outcomes, a lower rate of violent delinquency, and a lower rate of heavy alcohol use. <SECTION-HEADER> AMENDMENTS TO THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT.

This Act may be cited as the \"Balanced Trade Act of 2006\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS OF CONGRESS. Congress makes the following findings: Since 1997, the United States current account deficit, the broadest measure of United States international trade, has grown substantially, both absolutely and relative to gross domestic product (GDP), increasing from $140,400,000,000 in 1997 to $791,000,000,000 in 2005 . Strong manufacturing and agricultural sectors are important to nurturing and sustaining the health and security of the Nation's economy. The persistent current account deficit weakens United States manufacturing and agriculture and causes the loss of United States jobs. It can be estimated that the 2005 merchandise trade deficit cost the United States up to 15,000,000 jobs. The direction and trend of the current account deficit is unsustainable in the long run and needs immediate corrective action. It is critical to the Nation's economic future that the current account deficit be addressed by adopting statutory changes that will eliminate some of the causes of the trade deficit and will begin to move the Nation to a positive trade balance. <SECTION-HEADER> MANDATORY PRESIDENTIAL ACTION WHENEVER THE UNITED STATES CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT EXCEEDS 2 PERCENT OF THE UNITED STATES GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT.

In general. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), whenever there is a United States current account deficit that exceeds 2 percent of the gross domestic product, then for purposes of subsection (a), the President shall determine that fundamental international payments problems do exist that require special import measures to restrict imports. And within 30 days after making that determination, the President shall proclaim, for the period described in paragraph (2), a temporary import surcharge under this subsection in the form of duties on articles imported into the United States. Period of surcharge. The period of the surcharge proclaimed under this subsection is the period beginning on the date on which the surcharge is proclaimed and ending on the date on which there is not a United States current account deficit, or there is a United States current account deficit that does not exceed 1 percent of the gross domestic product. Amount of surcharge. Minimum. The amount of the surcharge proclaimed under this subsection shall be not less than 20 percent ad valorem. Adjustment to ensure period of not more than 24 months. Subject to subparagraph (A), the amount of the surcharge shall be adequate to ensure that the period in which the surcharge applies (as described in paragraph (2)) is not more than 24 months. Whenever the President determines that the amount of the surcharge is inadequate to ensure that the period in which the surcharge applies is not more than 24 months, the President shall increase the amount by at least 1 percent. Data used in making determinations. Each determination under this subsection shall be made using the most recently available information for a 1-year period compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce. Exceptions. Country exemptions. Subsection (e)(2) applies to a surcharge proclaimed under this subsection to the same extent that it applies to an import restricting action proclaimed pursuant to subsection . Product exceptions.

This Act may be cited as the \"Strengthening Homeland Security, Intelligence, and Essential Law Enforcement Departments Act of 2011\" or the \"SHIELD Act of 2011\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: The United States Armed Forces represent the finest fighting force in the world. An interruption in compensation could affect morale and cause hardship which would threaten United States security and the safety of our troops. It is a vital national interest that the United States Armed Forces, including reserve components, can operate with the assurance that they will continue to receive pay and allowances for their service if a funding gap occurs. Federal law enforcement officers are highly trained and dedicated men and women, committed to protecting liberty, public safety, and the security of our Nation from both foreign and domestic threats. They have no equal in the private sector, and perform a role that is both unique and vital to the continuing operation of the Federal Government and commerce during times of crisis. Each and every day, Federal law enforcement officers are engaged around the clock in activities that include, but are not limited to, dignitary protection, criminal investigation, homeland security, border security, intelligence gathering, and fighting waste, fraud and abuse. These critical Government functions cannot be interrupted due to an absence of Congressional appropriations or during periods of a Government shutdown, nor can we expect that the threats posed by violent criminals, terrorists and America's enemies will lessen during such periods of fiscal uncertainty. <SECTION-HEADER> PRIORITY PAYMENTS IF THE DEBT CEILING IS REACHED FOR DEFENSE AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

This Act may be cited as the \"Senior Nutrition Act of 2002\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress finds that senior citizens in the United States have significant out-of-pocket costs for medical expenses, especially for prescription drugs. 3 in 5 Medicare beneficiaries do not have dependable, affordable, prescription drug coverage. As medical costs continue to rise, many senior citizens are forced to make the difficult choice between purchasing prescription drugs and purchasing food. The commodity supplemental food program provides supplemental nutritious foods to senior citizens in a number of States and localities. Under the commodity supplemental food program women, infants, and children with household incomes up to 185 percent of the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines published annually by the Department of Health and Human Services may be eligible for supplemental foods. But senior citizens are ineligible for supplemental foods if their household incomes are greater than 130 percent of the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines. During fiscal year 2000 an average of more than 388,000 people each month participated in the commodity supplemental food program, and the majority of those participants, 293,000, were senior citizens. And in order to serve the neediest senior citizens, taking into account their high out-of-pocket medical expenses, the eligibility requirements for the commodity supplemental food program should be modified to make more senior citizens eligible for the supplemental foods provided under the program. <SECTION-HEADER> ELIGIBILITY OF ELDERLY PERSONS UNDER THE COMMODITY SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD PROGRAM.

This Act may be cited as the \"Frank Buckles World War I Memorial Act\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: In 2017, the United States will commemorate the centennial of its entry into World War I, which introduced the American soldier to the world in what would become a familiar role as defender, liberator, and promoter of peace and democracy. The support provided by the United States to Great Britain, France, and other allies in World War I marked the first time in the history of the United States that American soldiers went overseas to defend foreign soil against aggression, and it marked the true beginning of \"the American century\". Although World War I was called the \"Great War\" and the \"War to End All Wars\", in fact, the United States would commit its troops to the defense of foreign lands several more times in the 20th century. While three of these subsequent conflicts, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, rightfully have commemorative memorials on the National Mall in the District of Columbia, there is no memorial to World War I on the Mall, even though more Americans gave their lives in World War I than in either the Korean War or the Vietnam War. While a memorial to General John Pershing and the American Expeditionary Forces that he led during World War I is located in the District of Columbia, that memorial is not located on the Mall and does not commemorate the total participation of the United States and its Armed Forces in World War I. The District of Columbia War Memorial is located on the Mall, adjacent to the Lincoln Reflecting Pool between the World War II and Korean War memorials, and was erected in memory of the 499 residents of the District of Columbia who died in World War I. The District of Columbia War Memorial is in extreme disrepair and is often overlooked by residents and visitors to Washington. In recognition of the upcoming anniversaries of America's entry into World War I, and of the armistice that concluded World War I on November 11, 1918, and in order to honor the members of the United States Armed Forces who served in World War I and to ensure that future generations of Americans will know the complete history of America's 20th- century struggle against aggression and totalitarianism, it is timely and proper to rededicate the site of the District of Columbia War Memorial on the National Mall as a \"National and District of Columbia World War I Memorial\". Because this Act authorizes the rededication and related enhancement of a commemorative work that already exists, and that is already sited within the Reserve as defined in Commemorative Works Act, the provisions of the Commemorative Works Act regarding site approval and location of commemorative works do not apply to this Act. <SECTION-HEADER> AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH COMMEMORATIVE WORK. The World War I Memorial Foundation is authorized to establish a commemorative work rededicating the District of Columbia War Memorial as a National and District of Columbia World War I Memorial, including full restoration of the existing District of Columbia War Memorial.

Congress finds that there exists a unique relationship between the Federal Government and the Indian tribal governments, and a unique Federal trust responsibility to Indians. Indians experience some of the worst housing conditions in the country, such that 32.6 percent of Indian homes are overcrowded. 33 percent of Indian homes lack adequate solid waste management systems. 8 percent of Indian homes lack a safe indoor water supply, and approximately 90,000 Indian families are homeless or underhoused.

The Congress makes the following findings: In 1995, the Department of Health and Human Services found that there is a significant underage drinking problem and estimated that there are 11 million drinkers of alcoholic beverages who are under the age of 21. Of that number, 2 million are heavy drinkers of such beverages. In 1995, the proportion of students having 5 or more drinks in a row during the 2 week period preceding the Monitoring the Future Survey were 15 percent for 8th graders, 24 percent for 10th graders, and 30 percent for 12th graders. The median age at which children begin drinking alcoholic beverages is just over 13 years. 67 percent of students in the 8th grade have tried an alcoholic beverage. A 1995 survey found that 50 percent of the teenagers who were asked said that alcohol is a more serious problem among today's youth than illicit drugs. In 1993, nearly 10 percent of the clients admitted to State-funded alcohol treatment programs were under the age of 21. Alcoholic beverage companies spent $2 billion to advertise and promote their products in 1995. The budget of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism for the same year was $176 million. According to a study published in the American Journal of Public Health, viewing beer ads on television may predispose young people to drinking beer. Children who are more aware of beer advertisements hold more favorable beliefs about drinking beer and intend to drink beer more frequently as adults. Almost half of all adults think that alcohol industry advertising greatly influences underage youth to drink alcoholic beverages, another one-third think industry advertising has some influence. <SECTION-HEADER> REPORT OF SECRETARY ON ALCOHOL ADVERTISING.

On July 30, 1965, President Johnson signed into law the Social Security Amendments Act of 1965, popularly known as Medicare, which has transformed the delivery of health care in the United States and which, along with Social Security, reduced the rate of poverty among the elderly from 28.5 percent in 1966 to 9.1 percent in 2012. On July 2, 1964, President Johnson secured passage and signed into law the most sweeping civil rights legislation since Reconstruction, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination in employment, education, and public accommodations based on race, color, religion, or national origin. On November 8, 1965, President Johnson signed into law the Higher Education Act, which provided need-based financial aid to students in the form of scholarships, work-study grants, and loans, and thus made higher education more accessible to populations of persons who were previously unable to attend college because of economic circumstances. On October 3, 1965, President Johnson signed into law the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, which transformed the Nation's immigration system by abolishing the racially based quota system that had defined American immigration policy for four decades and replaced it with a policy whose central purpose was family reunification, with a preference for immigrants with specific skill sets. According to Robert A.

The Congress finds the following: Mental illness is the leading cause of disability, as reflected in lost years of productive life, in North America, in Europe, and, increasingly, in the world. By 2020, major depressive illness will be the leading cause of disability in the world for women and children. Mental illnesses strike individuals in the prime of their lives, often during adolescence and young adulthood. All ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Without treatment, the consequences of mental illness for the individual and society are staggering, including unnecessary disability, unemployment, substance abuse, homelessness, inappropriate incarceration, suicide, wasted lives, and an economic cost of more than $100 billion each year in the United States. The best treatments for serious mental illnesses today are highly effective so that between 70 and 90 percent of individuals with serious mental illness have significant reduction of symptoms and improved quality of life with a combination of pharmacological and psychosocial treatments and supports. Since early identification and treatment is of vital importance in treating mental illness, especially for children and young adults, the active, knowledgeable, and sympathetic involvement of parents and legal guardians is to be encouraged to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with generally accepted and established clinical practice. <SECTION-HEADER> DISCLOSURE TO PARENTS AND LEGAL GUARDIANS OF MENTAL ILLNESS TREATMENT OF CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 26.

{"source": "USDA Civil Rights Resolution Act of 2000 <SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"USDA Civil Rights Resolution Act of 2000\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Findings. Congress finds that there exists a strong public policy against discrimination against minority groups, whether the discrimination is committed by private persons or by the Federal Government in the operation of its programs. Whenever discrimination occurs in the conduct of Federal programs, the responsible Federal agencies should take quick and aggressive action to remedy the discrimination. In 1997, it was determined that the Department of Agriculture had, for decades, been guilty of civil rights violations against United States agricultural producers participating, or attempting to participate, in Department programs. In 1998, Congress created a 2-year waiver of the statute of limitations to allow persons injured by discrimination by the Department to seek redress in court or by filing an administrative compliant with the Department. Despite the waiver of the statute of limitations, it remains a difficult challenge to ensure that agricultural producers injured by discrimination by the Department over the years will get a speedy and balanced resolution of their complaints because it appears now that a number of complaints that have already been investigated by investigators hired by the Office of Civil Rights of the Department are not being resolved, and nothing is being done to expeditiously resolve these cases. And it is unfair for agricultural producers to be faced with these delays because the producers cannot get on with their lives, or plan their farming operations, until their complaints are resolved. And the producers are being wronged a second time by delays in resolving meritorious complaints. Purposes. It is the purpose of this Act to impose on the Department of Agriculture a reasonable time limit to resolve the complaints described in subsection. And if the Department fails to meet the reasonable time limit, to enable complainants to seek the experience and expertise of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice in resolving the complaints in a timely manner. <SECTION-HEADER> WAIVER OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. Section 741(b) of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 is amended by redesignating paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) as subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C), respectively. By striking \"(b) The\" and inserting the following: Administrative Determinations. In general. The\". By indenting the margins of subparagraphs (A), (B), and to reflect the amendment made by paragraph (2). And by adding at the end the following: Review by department of justice. In general. If a complainant seeks a determination by the Department of Agriculture on the merits of an eligible complaint under paragraph (1) and the complaint is not resolved by the Department within 270 days after the complaint has been investigated by the Department, the complainant may petition the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice to review the complaint. And to make recommendations to the Department of Agriculture to resolve the complaint. Deadline. The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice shall conduct the review, and make recommendations to resolve the complaint, not later than 30 days after the complainant files a petition under subparagraph (A). Access to review for other cases. In general. The right to review by the Department of Justice under this paragraph shall be made available to any complainant with a complaint that is not considered an eligible complaint under the time criteria described in subsection (e). And is pending at the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Agriculture on the date of enactment of this paragraph. Tolling. In the case of any complaint that is reviewed by the Department of Justice under this paragraph, after the review process is completed the complainant shall be deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies of the complainant. And may file an action on the complaint in United States District Court. And any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled for the period beginning on the date that the complaint was filed at the Department of Agriculture and ending on the date of completion of the review by the Department of Justice.\".", "summary": "Makes the right to review by the Department of Justice available to any complainant with a complaint that: (1) is not considered an eligible complaint under specified time criteria.

This Act may be cited as the \"Uterine Fibroid Research and Education Act of 2003\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress finds as follows: The development of uterine fibroids is a common and significant health problem, affecting women of all ages, racial backgrounds, and socioeconomic levels. It has been estimated that between 20 and 30 percent of women of reproductive age have uterine fibroids, though not all have been diagnosed. Studies indicate the prevalence could be much higher. Symptomatic uterine fibroids can cause heavy bleeding, pain, and reproductive problems, including infertility. There is no known cause of uterine fibroids. Uterine fibroids are the most common indication for hysterectomy, accounting for approximately one-third of hysterectomies, or 200,000 procedures annually. African American women are 2 to 3 times more likely to develop uterine fibroids than women of other racial groups. The estimated annual charges for inpatient care for uterine fibroids totaled more than $2,000,000,000 in 1997. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found a \"remarkable lack of high quality evidence supporting the effectiveness of most interventions for symptomatic fibroids\". <SECTION-HEADER> RESEARCH WITH RESPECT TO UTERINE FIBROIDS.

The Federal Government spends more than $6 billion annually in energy costs. Reducing Federal energy costs can help save money, create jobs, and reduce waste. Energy savings performance contracts and utility energy service contracts are tools for utilizing private sector investment to upgrade Federal facilities without any up-front cost to the taxpayer. Performance contracting is a way to retrofit Federal buildings using private sector investment in the absence of appropriated dollars. Retrofits seek to reduce energy use, improve infrastructure, protect national security, and cut facility operations and maintenance costs. <SECTION-HEADER> USE OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES IN FEDERAL BUILDINGS. Implementation of Identified Energy Efficiency Measures. Section 543(f)(4) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 USC. 8253(f)(4)) is amended to read as follows: Implementation of identified energy efficiency measures. In general.

This Act may be cited as the \"Election Jamming Prevention Act of 2006\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: The most fundamental right accorded to United States citizens by the Constitution is the right to vote, and unimpeded exercise of the right to vote is essential to the functioning of our democracy. Historically, significant efforts have been undertaken to prevent qualified individuals from exercising this right. Poll taxes, property requirements, and literacy tests were once used to restrict voters' access to the polls. Now, efforts like deceptive practices, intimidation, and dirty tricks are used to impede qualified voters' exercise of their right to vote, to prevent voters from making informed decisions as to how to cast that vote, and to prevent candidates, parties, and organizations from engaging in constitutionally protected political speech. In recent elections, there have been allegations of political campaigns and committees using telephone jamming techniques to shut down the communication operations of groups supporting their political opponents. In November 2002, according to the Department of Justice, groups working on behalf of the Republican candidates in New Hampshire conspired to shut down Democratic get-out-the- vote efforts by placing hang-up calls to the phones of the Manchester Democratic Party and the Manchester Professional Firefighters Association, which were providing qualified voters rides to the election polling places. Several people have pled guilty or been convicted in connection with the incident. As a result of the hang-up call effort, the phone lines of the Manchester Democratic Party and the Manchester Professional Firefighters Association were jammed on election day 2002 and qualified voters were unable to access information that would have facilitated their access to polling places. The use of telephones or other communication devices to jam election-related communications should be prohibited in order to protect qualified voters' right to vote. <SECTION-HEADER> PROHIBITION ON PREVENTING OR OBSTRUCTING THE BROADCAST OR EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION THROUGH TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEVICES.

{"source": "To ensure the emergency protection of Iranian dissidents living in Camp LibertyHurriya and to provide for their admission as refugees to the United States. <SECTION-HEADER> STATEMENT OF US POLICY. It shall be the policy of the United States to take all necessary and appropriate steps in accordance with international agreements to support the commitments of the United States to ensure the physical security and protection of Camp LibertyHurriya residents, members of the opposition Mujahedeen e-Khalq (MEK), in accordance with the United States Embassy Statement on Transfer of Security Responsibility for Camp Ashraf of December 28, 2008. Assist the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in ensuring the rapid and orderly resettlement of all residents of Camp LibertyHurriya to safe locations outside of Iraq. And permit the admission as refugees of the residents of Camp LibertyHurriya to the United States, who express a desire for such resettlement. <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. The Congress makes the following findings: The United States recognized the residents of the former Camp Ashraf who now reside in Camp LibertyHurriya as \"protected persons\" under the Fourth Geneva Convention and committed itself to protect the residents until their final disposition. The United States expects the Government of Iraq to continue this commitment of protection of the residents of Camp LibertyHurriya, as reflected in the United States Embassy Statement on Transfer of Security Responsibility for Camp Ashraf of December 28, 2008. The residents of the former Camp Ashraf, who now reside in Camp LibertyHurriya, renounced violence and unilaterally disarmed more than a decade ago. Dozens of residents of Camp LibertyHurriya were permanent residents or political refugees in the United States. Camp LibertyHurriya residents have provided valuable intelligence to the international community concerning efforts by the Government of Iran to establish a nuclear weapons capability and to supply the terrorist groups in Iraq with Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Camp LibertyHurriya residents share the desire of the United States in seeing the establishment of a peaceful, democratic, non-nuclear government in Iran with full rights for women and religious and ethnic minorities. The residents of Camp LibertyHurriya are cooperating in the framework of an agreement between the United Nations and the Government of Iraq to transfer the residents out of Iraq. Despite Iraq's acceptance of the US commitment to protect Camp Ashraf residents, the unarmed residents have been attacked five times in 2009, 2011, and 2013 during their residence in the former Camp Ashraf and Camp LibertyHurriya by external persons and organizations, including Iraqi security forces, killing more than 100 residents and wounding 1,000 others. Iraqi security forces are permanently stationed all around Camp LibertyHurriya, despite their history of violence against the unarmed residents, while all LibertyHurriya residents are kept inside the Camp's walled compound, with no freedom of movement for the residents outside the Camp and no access to counsel, family, NGOs, and press. <SECTION-HEADER> ACTIONS TO PROTECT IRANIAN DISSIDENTS LIVING IN CAMP LIBERTY HURRIYA. The United States shall take all necessary and appropriate steps to ensure the safety of the residents of Camp LibertyHurriya. The United States shall provide all necessary and appropriate assistance to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to process applications by the residents of Camp LibertyHurriya for refugee status and to secure their orderly resettlement in safe locations outside of Iraq, including in the United States for any such residents who express such a desire. The United States shall timely admit as refugees the residents of Camp LibertyHurriya in the US and in doing so shall not delay or bar such resettlement merely because any such resident is or has been a member of, or supports or has supported, organizations or groups that were subject to the Secretary of State's decision of September 21, 2012, in Public Notice 8049, notwithstanding Section Section 212(a)(3)(B) and 212(a)(3)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, as amended. Within 90 days of the effective date of this Act, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security shall report to the Congress on steps taken by the United States to guard the safety of the residents of Camp LibertyHurriya and to secure their orderly resettlement in safe locations in accordance with the provisions of this Act.", "summary": "Directs the United States to: (1) take all necessary and appropriate steps to ensure the safety of the residents of Camp LibertyHurriya in Iraq.

This Act may be cited as the \"Southern New Mexico and El Paso, Texas, Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury Care Improvement Act of 2011\". <SECTION-HEADER> REPORT ON ESTABLISHMENT OF POLYTRAUMA REHABILITATION CENTER OR POLYTRAUMA NETWORK SITE OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS IN SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO AND EL PASO, TEXAS, REGION. Findings. Congress makes the following findings: The military population of the southern New Mexico and El Paso, Texas, region has grown greatly since the United States has been involved in military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and members of the Armed Forces returning from such operations to such region will require care at polytrauma centers as a result of their involvement with such operations. The population at Fort Bliss in Texas and New Mexico is expected to grow from 9,300 members of the Armed Forces in 2005 to an estimated 33,400 members of the Armed Forces by 2012 because of the ongoing expansion of Fort Bliss. Traumatic brain injury has become known as one of the signature wounds of service in the Armed Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan because of its high occurrence among veterans of such service. Many members of the Armed Forces returning to the El Paso, Texas, and southern New Mexico region from overseas service in the Armed Forces are expected to suffer from traumatic brain injury or other forms of injury requiring treatment at a polytrauma rehabilitation center or polytrauma network site. A recent RAND Corporation study estimates that as many as 20 percent of the veterans who served in the Armed Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan have a traumatic brain injury as a result of such service, and many of these veterans require ongoing care for mild, moderate, or severe traumatic brain injury. The Department of Veterans Affairs recommends that all veterans experiencing a polytraumatic injury be referred to a polytrauma rehabilitation center or polytrauma network site of the Department. The polytrauma system of care of the Department includes 4 polytrauma rehabilitation centers and 21 polytrauma network sites, none of which are located within 300 miles driving distance of Fort Bliss, White Sands Missile Range, or Holloman Air Force Base. The large military population in the southern New Mexico and El Paso, Texas, region necessitates a new polytrauma rehabilitation center or polytrauma network site of the Department to deal with the significant hardships veterans residing in such region require. Report. In general. Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall submit to Congress a report on the feasibility and advisability of establishing a polytrauma rehabilitation center or polytrauma network site of the Department of Veterans Affairs in the southern New Mexico and El Paso, Texas, region that is within a reasonable driving distance of Fort Bliss, White Sands Missile Range, and Holloman Air Force Base. Requirements. The report required by paragraph (1) shall include the following: An assessment of the adequacy of existing Department facilities in the southern New Mexico and El Paso, Texas, region to address matters that are otherwise addressed by polytrauma rehabilitation centers and polytrauma network sites of the Department. A comparative assessment of the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs for individuals with traumatic brain injuries in urban areas with the effectiveness of such programs for individuals with traumatic brain injuries in rural and frontier communities. An assessment of whether therapies that can prevent or remediate the development of secondary neurologic conditions related to traumatic brain injury can be interrupted by stress caused by living in an urban area. The relation of high cost of living to the recovery of veterans and the impact on their families in comparison to recovery in an area where there is a lower cost of living. Locations. In preparing the report required by paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider and evaluate various locations for the potential location of a new polytrauma rehabilitation center or polytrauma network site.

{"source": "To protect homes, small businesses, and other private property rights, by limiting the power of eminent domain. <SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Protection of Homes, Small Businesses, and Private Property Act of 2005\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: The protection of homes, small businesses, and other private property rights against government seizures and other unreasonable government interference is a fundamental principle and core commitment of our Nation's Founders. As Thomas Jefferson wrote on April 6, 1816, the protection of such rights is \"the first principle of association, the guarantee to every one of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it\". The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution specifically provides that \"private property\" shall not \"be taken for public use without just compensation\". The Fifth Amendment thus provides an essential guarantee of liberty against the abuse of the power of eminent domain, by permitting government to seize private property only \"for public use\". On June 23, 2005, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in Kelo v. City of New London, No. 04-108. As the Court acknowledged, \"it has long been accepted that the sovereign may not take the property of A for the sole purpose of transferring it to another private party B\", and that under the Fifth Amendment, the power of eminent domain may be used only \"for public use\". The Court nevertheless held, by a 5-4 vote, that government may seize the home, small business, or other private property of one owner, and transfer that same property to another private owner, simply by concluding that such a transfer would benefit the community through increased economic development. The Court's decision in Kelo is alarming because, as Justice O'Connor accurately noted in her dissenting opinion, joined by the Chief Justice and Justices Scalia and Thomas, the Court has \"effectively . . deleted the words `for public use' from the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment\" and thereby \"refused to enforce properly the Federal Constitution\". Under the Court's decision in Kelo, Justice O'Connor warns, \"the specter of condemnation hangs over all property. Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory\". Justice O'Connor further warns that, under the Court's decision in Kelo, \"any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party\", and \"the fallout from this decision will not be random. The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms. As for the victims, the government now has license to transfer property from those with fewer resources to those with more. The Founders cannot have intended this perverse result\". As an amicus brief filed by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, AARP, and other organizations noted, \"absent a true public use requirement the takings power will be employed more frequently. The takings that result will disproportionately affect and harm the economically disadvantaged and, in particular, racial and ethnic minorities and the elderly\". It is appropriate for Congress to take action, consistent with its limited powers under the Constitution, to restore the vital protections of the Fifth Amendment and to protect homes, small businesses, and other private property rights against unreasonable government use of the power of eminent domain. It would also be appropriate for States to take action to voluntarily limit their own power of eminent domain. As the Court in Kelo noted, \"nothing in our opinion precludes any State from placing further restrictions on its exercise of the takings power\". <SECTION-HEADER> PROTECTION OF HOMES, SMALL BUSINESSES, AND OTHER PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS.

{"source": "A bill to give States the flexibility to reduce bureaucracy by streamlining enrollment processes for the medicaid and State children's health insurance programs through better linkages with programs providing nutrition and related assistance to low-income families. <SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Children's Express Lane to Health Coverage Act of 2003\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. PURPOSE. Findings. Congress finds the following: Despite gains made in recent years, 8,900,000 children in the United States are uninsured. Of those, 6,900,000 are eligible for public health insurance coverage. Most low-income uninsured children are enrolled in nutrition and related programs that operate under income guidelines similar to those of the medicaid program. In fact, 63 percent, or 4,300,000, low-income uninsured children are in families that receive benefits through the food stamps program, the National school lunch program, or the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children . The public would be well served if Federal means-tested public programs were able to improve administrative efficiency and coordination as well as reduce unnecessary bureaucracy. Uninsured children would be well served if their enrollment in a nutrition-based or other means-tested program could serve as a gateway to health coverage. Existing law already allows children to be found income eligible for WIC based on their enrollment in the medicaid program. Current law does not, however, give States adequate flexibility to make an income determination for eligibility for the medicaid or State children's health insurance program based on an uninsured child's enrollment in WIC or another public program. Purpose. The purpose of this Act is to give States the flexibility to find children income eligible for the medicaid program or State children's health insurance program based on the fact that the children are eligible for nutrition assistance or similar public programs with comparable income standards and methodologies. <SECTION-HEADER> STATE OPTION TO PROVIDE FOR SIMPLIFIED DETERMINATIONS OF A CHILD'S FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE UNDER MEDICAID OR CHILD HEALTH ASSISTANCE UNDER SCHIP.

Russell National School Lunch Act, and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, provided that such agency has fiscal liabilities or responsibilities affected or potentially affected by such determinations and provided that all information furnished by such agency pursuant to this subparagraph is used solely for purposes of determining eligibility for medical assistance under the State plan approved under this title or for child health assistance under a State plan approved under title XXI. Nothing in subparagraph (A) shall be construed to authorize the denial of medical assistance under a State plan approved under this title or of child health assistance under a State plan approved under title XXI to an individual who, without the application of this paragraph or an option exercised thereunder, would qualify for such assistance.

At the option of a State, the financial eligibility process described in subparagraph (A) may apply to an individual who is older than age 21 if such individual's eligibility for medical assistance is based on pregnancy or if such individual is a parent, guardian, or other caretaker relative of an individual found eligible under subparagraph .\".

{"source": "Access to Inpatient Rehabilitation Therapy Act of 2017 <SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the \"Access to Inpatient Rehabilitation Therapy Act of 2017\". <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Findings. Congress finds the following: Intensive, coordinated medical rehabilitation provided in inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and units is critical to Medicare beneficiaries with injuries, illnesses, disabilities, and chronic conditions in order to return to health, full function, independent living, and a high quality of life. The Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services uses an \"intensity of therapy\" requirement to help determine which Medicare beneficiaries are appropriate for treatment in an inpatient rehabilitation hospital or unit. CMS has interpreted the intensity of therapy requirement through application of the so- called \"Three Hour Rule\" (42 C. F. R. 412.622(a)(3)(ii)) which requires the patient to be able to participate in three hours of rehabilitation therapy per day, five days per week, or 15 hours of rehabilitation therapy over a one-week period. Before 2010, CMS regulations explicitly stated that physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, andor orthotics and prosthetics were counted toward the Three Hour Rule on an as-needed basis. In addition, CMS regulations stated that \"other therapeutic modalities\" that were determined by the physician and the rehabilitation team to be needed by the patient \"on a priority basis\" would qualify toward satisfaction of the rule . This language allowed recreational therapy to count toward satisfaction of the Three Hour Rule for patients who required this mix of therapies on a priority basis in the inpatient rehabilitation hospital or unit setting. CMS by regulation (74 Fed. Reg. 39811 revised these prior regulations, effective January 1, 2010, by limiting the Three Hour Rule to recognize only four services and removing the discretion of the physician and the rehabilitation team to count other therapeutic services needed by the patient toward satisfaction of the Three Hour Rule. As a result, recreational therapy services are often not available to patients who require medically necessary recreational therapy as part of their plan of care. Recreational therapy is a treatment service designed to restore, remediate, and rehabilitate a patient's level of functioning and independence in life activities, to promote health and wellness as well as to reduce or eliminate the activity limitations and restrictions to participation in life situations caused by an illness or disabling condition. Recreational therapy in the inpatient rehabilitation hospital and unit setting is provided by qualified recreational therapists when required by the patient's condition and prescribed by a physician as part of a patient's plan of care. Purpose. It is the purpose of this Act to restore reliance on the professional judgment of the treating physician and the rehabilitation team when determining whether a Medicare patient meets the intensity of therapy requirement of an inpatient rehabilitation hospital or unit in order for that patient to gain access to the appropriate mix of medically necessary therapeutic rehabilitation services in that setting, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and, as needed, speech therapy, orthotics and prosthetics, and recreational therapy. <SECTION-HEADER> INCLUDING RECREATIONAL THERAPY AMONG THE THERAPY MODALITIES THAT CONSTITUTE AN INTENSIVE REHABILITATION THERAPY PROGRAM IN DETERMINING THE MEDICAL NECESSITY OF SERVICES IN AN INPATIENT REHABILITATION FACILITY (IRF).

This Act may be cited as the \"Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2013\". <SECTION-HEADER> PURPOSE. To establish consistent eligibility requirements for graduate medical schools operating outside of the United States and Canada in order to increase accountability and protect American students and taxpayer dollars. <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: Three for-profit schools in the Caribbean receive more than two-thirds of all Federal funding under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 that goes to students enrolled at foreign graduate medical schools, despite those three schools being exempt from meeting the same eligibility requirements as the majority of graduate medical schools located outside of the United States and Canada. The National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation and the Department of Education recommend that all foreign graduate medical schools should be required to meet the same eligibility requirements to participate in Federal funding under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and see no rationale for excluding certain schools. The attrition rate at United States medical schools averaged 3 percent for the class beginning in 2009 while rates at for-profit Caribbean schools have reached 26 percent or higher. In 2013, residency match rates for foreign trained graduates averaged 53 percent compared to 94 percent for graduates of medical schools in the United States.
