Whereas, on September 24, 1984, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Public Law 98\u2013417; 98 Stat. 1585), commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, at which time President Reagan indicated that generic drugs might save American consumers $1,000,000,000 over the next 10 years; Whereas this landmark law created the regulatory mechanism under which the Food and Drug Administration approves safe and affordable generic drugs; Whereas each year for the past quarter century, the generic pharmaceutical industry has delivered billions of dollars in savings on the purchase of prescription drugs, far exceeding the original estimate; Whereas a May 2009 report showed that during the preceding 10-year period, the use of generic drugs has saved the American health care system more than $734,000,000,000, with the most-recent annual average exceeding $121,000,000,000; Whereas generic drugs accounted for more than 72 percent of all prescription drugs dispensed, yet accounted for only 17 percent of the spending on all prescription drugs, a differential that reflects the dramatically lower prices paid for generic drugs, which not only reduces consumer and taxpayer spending but also increases patient access to needed medicines; and Whereas while the Hatch-Waxman Act does not have an explicit pathway for approval by the Food and Drug Administration of lower-priced versions of cutting-edge biologic medicines, which account for a rapidly growing portion of prescription medicine spending, the Act does provide a solid framework for such a pathway: Now, therefore, be it That it is the sense of Senate that\u2014 enactment of the Hatch-Waxman Act (Public Law 98\u2013417; 98 Stat. 1585) in 1984 served to create the modern generic pharmaceutical industry, which has provided consumers with access to affordable drugs, yielding significant health and economic benefits for the Nation\u2019s health care system; Senator Orrin Hatch and Representative Henry Waxman deserve the Nation\u2019s gratitude for authoring and championing this landmark bipartisan legislation; and Congress should build on the work of these dedicated policymakers and enact legislation to create a pathway for approval by the Food and Drug Administration of safe and affordable generic versions of biologic medicines.

Short title This Act may be cited as the Clean Lakes, Estuaries, and Rivers Act of 2005. 2. FindingsCongress finds the following: Polluted runoff from precipitation events is the greatest remaining impediment to the Nation in meeting the Clean Water Act objective of restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters. The rate of sediment runoff from construction sites is typically 10 to 20 times greater than the rate from agricultural lands and 1,000 to 2,000 times greater than the rate from forest lands. During a short period of time, construction activities can contribute more sediment to streams than would otherwise be deposited over several decades, causing physical and biological harm to the Nation\u2019s waters. Siltation is the second leading cause of water quality impairment in rivers and streams. Siltation is the third leading cause of water quality impairment in lakes. Siltation is the leading cause of degraded wetland integrity. Silt robs water bodies of sunlight, killing grasses and burying the benthic community. States are developing and implementing total maximum daily loads for pollutants that impair water quality, and exempting entire classes of pollution sources from permitting requirements for stormwater discharges will place an inequitable burden on other sources of siltation. Exempting up to 30,000 oil and gas construction sites annually from permitting requirements for stormwater discharges will harm human health and the environment and impair the ability of States to address the single largest source of water quality impairment. 3. RepealSection 502(24) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 USC. 1362(24)), relating to the definition of oil and gas exploration, is repealed. "}

I 113th CONGRESS 1st Session H. R. 2811 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES July 24, 2013 Mr. Cohen (for himself, Mr. Huffman, and Mr. Grijalva) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Appropriations A BILL Making supplemental appropriations for the National Institutes of Health for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013, and for other purposes. 1. Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Research First Act of 2013. 2. FindingsThe Congress finds as follows: In fiscal year 2013, the budget of the National Institutes of Health was decreased by approximately $1.55 billion pursuant to section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 USC. 901a). The National Institutes of Health is the true Department of Defense for the citizens of the United States, conducting vital research to fight the enemy of disease and protect the infrastructure of the human body. Such research funding should not be slashed while the Pentagon budget continues to increase. The national security interests of the United States can be well served by reducing the total number of deployed nuclear warheads and their delivery systems, as suggested by the Department of Defense\u2019s January 2012 strategic guidance titled Sustaining US Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense. The Government Accountability Office has found that there is significant waste in the construction of the nuclear facilities of the National Nuclear Security Administration of the Department of Energy. Significant savings can also be found by reducing expenditures on weapons which the military has not requested such as the Abrams Tank, bringing military and infrastructure operations in Afghanistan to a close, and decreasing the Nation\u2019s reliance on expensive, private contractors. 3. Supplemental appropriations for the National Institutes of HealthThere is appropriated to the National Institute of Health, for an additional amount for the purpose of carrying out title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 USC. 281 et seq.), $1,550,000,000, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for fiscal year 2013. 4. RescissionsOf the unobligated balances of the following accounts, the following amounts are rescinded: Department of Defense\u2014Overseas Contingency Operations\u2014Operation and Maintenance\u2014Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund, $400,000,000.

Short titleThis Act may be cited as the Organ Transplant Authorization Act of 2008. 2. FindingsCongress makes the following findings: The National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 amended the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide for, by contract with a private nonprofit entity, the establishment and operation of an Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network represents a unique public-private organization that requires each party to contribute a certain amount of funding to the network\u2019s operation. The National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 provided a statutory annual authorization of $2,000,000 for such purpose with remaining costs to be paid by the private sector contractor. In 1984, the annual total operating cost of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network was $5,000,000, but in 2007 such annual cost exceeded $27,000,000. The original authorization amount for the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network has never been increased since the enactment of the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984, resulting in a greatly increased cost burden on the private sector contractor. Much of the increased costs of operation of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network have resulted from additional duties and responsibilities assigned to the private sector contractor by Federal regulations and Secretarial directives. 3. Increased funding for the Organ Procurement and Transplantation NetworkSection 372(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 USC. 274(a)) is amended by striking $2,000,000 and inserting $7,000,000. "}

Short titleThis Act may be cited as the American Flag Display Protection Act. 2. FindingsCongress finds the following: The most important symbol of any Nation is the national flag. Since ancient times, flags or banners have served to identify and unify groups of people, especially in times of war. On June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress passed the following resolution: Resolved, that the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation. Today, the American flag has 13 horizontal stripes, 7 red and 6 white. These stripes represent the 13 original States. The flag still has its field of blue, which represents the Union and today contains 50 stars, one for each State. The United Sates Code specifies a Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, and states that the flag should be displayed on all days. President Theodore Roosevelt said, There can be no divided allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn\u2019t an American at all. We have room for but one flag, the American flag. Certain public school officials have attempted to ban students\u2019 display of the flag of the United States. 3. Prohibition on receipt of Federal fundsNo funds from any Federal source may be provided by contract or by grant to an elementary school, secondary school, or institution of higher education (including any subelement of such school or institution) if the school or institution (or subelement) has a policy or practice (regardless of when implemented) that either prohibits, or in effect prevents, the right of a student to display or wear, in a respectful manner, a representation of the flag of the United States in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to the right of a student to display or wear, in a respectful manner, any other representation.

Whereas Poppies are worn and displayed as a symbolic tribute to fallen and future veterans and members of the Armed Forces; Whereas the use of the poppy symbolically comes from the poem In Flanders Fields, which movingly begins, In Flanders Fields the poppies blow, between the crosses, row on row, referring to the poppies that sprang up in the churned-up earth of newly dug soldiers\u2019 graves in parts of Belgium and France following World War I; Whereas at the end of World War I, the American Legion adopted the poppy as a symbol of freedom and the blood sacrificed by members of the Armed Forces in war; Whereas the American Legion has long utilized the red poppy as its official flower, symbolizing the blood shed by those who have served in the United States Armed Forces; Whereas the poppy is worn in England and Canada on Remembrance Day, also known as Armistice Day and Poppy Day, to commemorate members of the armed forces who have died in the line of duty; Whereas as the United States commemorates the 100th anniversary of its entrance into World War I and the American Legion approaches its 100th anniversary, it is fitting to expand the meaning the poppy and formally recognize its historic symbolism; Whereas wearing a poppy can unite citizens from across the country who wish to show their patriotism and appreciation for those who serve as members of the United States Armed Forces; and Whereas the Friday before each Memorial Day is an appropriate day to recognize as National Poppy Day: Now, therefore, be it That the House of Representatives\u2014 supports the goals and ideals of National Poppy Day; and (2)encourages all citizens, residents, and visitors of the United States to join in observing National Poppy Day to honor every member of the Armed Forces who has died in the name of liberty, freedom, and democracy while also showing their support for living veterans, members of the Armed Forces, and their families.
